        <p>Howdy! My name is Ryan Mok. I am born and raised in Lincolnwood, IL, which is a northern suburb of Chicago that nearly everyone
        has never heard of. I am the youngest of 4 children, but am often mistaken to be older than I am due to my height when compared to my siblings.
        I tend to spend most of my free time either being with my childhood friends, going to the gym, cooking, playing video games, or playing my saxophone.</p>
        
        <p>As far as my education goes, I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014 where I received my Bachelor's of Fine
        Arts in Music; I was and still am a fairly large music nerd. During my time at U of I, I was very active in the athletic bands program which included both a Marching, Volleyball, and
        Basketball Band that performed at every home game; I joined mostly becasue a lot of my friends were also in them...I to this day still know very little about sports (yay sports?).
        Aside from being in the university ensembles, the athletic bands eventually led to me starting an ad-hoc ensemble known as <strong>Sixth Street Brass</strong>. Our primary
        style included "riot-jazz", but we also transcribed and performed arrangements of popular music such as "No-Diggity" by Blackstreet (I promise, we found a way to make it work).
        For the most part I know pretty much nothing when it comes to web design and coding, but I'm very determined to learn as much as I possibly can!
